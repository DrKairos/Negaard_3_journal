I did not complete my game. There is still some more I could add to it. Not knowing how to do certain things contributed to not getting it done in time. I could not work on the game outside of school because I have a Mac and can not get some of the needed programs. I could not work on it after school because I have to go home. I don't always get here early enough to work on it before school.
