Explain in your own words -- What happens with nested for loops?
If we have for loops that count to 10:
The first one runs through whatever is in it 10 times.
The second one runs 10 times.
The first one repeats that 9 more times, doing whatever 100 times total.
This is counting through a 2D grid since it counts through each y with each x.
