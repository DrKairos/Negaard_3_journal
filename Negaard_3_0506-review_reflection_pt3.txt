Line #a 
if (i = 0){ System.out.print("8888");
The beginning of the line is 8888. i is x

Line #b 
System.out.print(map[i][j]);
This prints whatever is on the map array if it is an x

Line #c
System.out.println(".");
This one is .println so it starts the next line when it is at the x limit
e is only .print so no newline

Line #d 
System.out.println(map[i][j]);
This prints the player when they are on a map edge

Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop

Explain the use of static
