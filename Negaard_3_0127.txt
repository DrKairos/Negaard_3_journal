1. How do you add an image to a slick game?
In my game using the slick 2d library I was able to put images into my game, by locating them through a res folder. 
2. Where is the image drawn?
The code for this was first to create a new image in the object's class, then name it. Make it a new image and then send a path for the image to be found. Ex Image Cat = new Image("res/NyanCat.png");
