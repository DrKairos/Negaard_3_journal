1. How do we make a class?
	Public class Donut {

}

2. Donut Bismarck = new Donut();
Is this a class constructor?
No, it's creating another Donut - it's calling the class constructor, with Donut();
 
3. How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?
	Public class Breakfast {
		boolean hasEggs;
		int numOfEggs;
		boolean hasBacon;
		boolean hasOrangeJuice;
		int sliceOfBacon;

		Breakfast(int a, int b, int c, boolean d, boolean e, boolean f); {
			this.numOfEggs = a;
			this.slicesOfBacon =b;
			this.hasEggs = c;
			this.hasBacon = d;
			this.hasOrangeJuice = e;
	}
}

	//A getter gets things, namely in Java and oop
	//A getter is usually publicso that it can return private
	//Values, a getter for slices of bacon tells other classes 
	//How many slices of bacon	
	
	public int getSlicesOfBacon() {
		return this.slicesOfBacon;
	}

	//A getter returns a value, by contrast, a setter sets values.
	//For example, to set whether we have orange juice.	

	public void setHasOrangeJuice(boolean a) {
		this.hasOrangeJuice = a;
	 }
}

4. An array of Breakfast
int[] numbers; //this is an array of numbers
char[] characters; //this is an array of chars
boolean[][]; //this is a 2D array of booleans

Breakfast eliBreakfast = new Breakfast(2, 4, true, true, true);
Breakfast[] eliBreakfast = {eliBreakfast}; 

5. Using getters and setters
eliBreakfast.setSlicesOfBacon(12);


6. Getter
eliBreakfast.getHasOrangeJuice();
