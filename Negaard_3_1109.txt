1.Are you ready to begin coding your game?
No, because we started this on Friday and I left half way through class and so I didn't get anything done except for the basic stuff. I'm not even sure how people are already done.

2. What will be your biggest challenges?
My biggest challenges will be figuring out how to code my story.

3. Why?
Because I may not know how to do something.
