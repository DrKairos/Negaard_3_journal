1. Are you? Why or why not?
Yes.
2. This is a real question -- describe what you did the days we went over art methods. What did you write? type? What were your thoughts?
I took notes and typed out the examples. I thought it was cool.
3. Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals (as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not?
Yes
4. Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
Yes, so I could get a general idea of what I am doing.
5. Write a sample method for making a sequence of red squares on the canvas.
 private void drawSomeCircle(GraphicsContext gc, int x, int y, int d){
        gc.setFill(Color.DARKGREEN);
        gc.fillRect(x, y, d, d);
